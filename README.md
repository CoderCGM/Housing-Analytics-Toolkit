# **Real Estate Assistant**
This project is an end-to-end real estate application designed to showcase a comprehensive data science skill set. It handles the entire machine learning lifecycle, from dealing with messy, real-world raw data to deploying an intuitive application. The goal is to provide end-users—both buyers and sellers—with a powerful "assistant" to help them make informed decisions with just a few clicks.

The application is built using Streamlit and includes three main modules: a Price Predictor, an Analytics Dashboard, and a Recommender.

## Technology Stack
- Languages: Python
- Core Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Data Visualization: Plotly, Seaborn
- Web Framework: Streamlit
- Tools & Methodologies: Web Scraping, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning, Hybrid Recommender Systems

## Key Features & Modules
1. Price Predictor Module 
  This module allows users to get a quick and accurate price estimate for a property. By providing details such as location, number of rooms, and square footage, the user receives a price prediction in seconds.
  Skills Demonstrated: This module highlights proficiency in supervised machine learning and feature engineering. A Random Forest Regressor model was trained on the cleaned, structured data to provide robust   predictions.

2. Analytics Dashboard 
The analytics dashboard provides key real estate market insights through interactive visualizations. Users can explore various trends to better understand market demand and price dynamics.

Skills Demonstrated: This section showcases strong data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization skills. 
The dashboard includes features such as:
- Feature Word Cloud: To identify the most common or desirable property features.
- Price Trends: To visualize price changes over time based on area and number of rooms.
- Market Demand Analysis: To reveal what sectors or property types are in high demand.

3. Home Recommender Module 
This module acts as a personal real estate assistant, suggesting properties to users based on their search criteria and viewing history.

Skills Demonstrated: This feature highlights an understanding of unsupervised learning and hybrid recommendation systems. The model uses a blend of collaborative and content-based filtering to provide highly relevant and personalized recommendations.
